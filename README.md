# Cyber-Physical-Systems
A cyber-physical system (CPS) is an integration of computation with physical
processes whose behavior is defined by both cyber and physical parts of the
system. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical
processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect
computations and vice versa. As an intellectual challenge, CPS is about the
intersection, not the union, of the physical and the cyber.
